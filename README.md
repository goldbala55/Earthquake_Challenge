# Earthquake_Challenge
Create a multilayered map displaying global earthquake data 

## Project Overview
Create a map that displays earthquake, major earthquake, and tectonic plate outlines to display the concentration of the quakes as well as relative location to the tectonic plate boundaries.  Use circle markers scaling the size and color based on the earthquake magnitude.  Provide magnitude and location popups for each marker.  
The map has a color legend for the magnitude and the layer icon opens to allow complete customization on the data displayed along with optional mapping backgrounds.
